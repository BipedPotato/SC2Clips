      <p>I made this game for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in under 48 hours with Rust and Bevy.
        I struggled due to my limited 1 week understanding of Rust and Bevy and had to learn 
        an entirely new area of Bevy as i had only used 2d prior to this jam

      <p>I made this game for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam in 48 hours with my own game engine built in C++ and OpenGL.
        Ultimately i abandoned the engine as it was extremely hard to maintain and it was overall not very efficient or practical.
        This was one of the hardest game jams i ever participated in and was the first one i made a video for.
        The video was really badly edited and undeservingly got more than 7k views only because the idea was unique.

      <h2>BenBonk Game Jam #3</h2>
      <p>I made this game for the BenBonk Game Jam #3 in 72 hours using Unity. I was really satisfied with this game 
        as a second game jam game i got #5 out of 133 games in terms of theme. However i did pretty horribly in the music category and got bumped down to just above average overall.
